# Application-of-Mathematical-Models-on-Smart-Grid

In this project, we tried to find a math model that includes a load shifting algorithm, pv an storage systems to lower the electricity bill.
All math models were implemented on MATLAB
Rather than using an optimization algorithm like GWO, we came up with an algorithm which gave us flexibility for coding. 
Load shifting algorithm was implemented considering user dissatisfaction.
Our final report is available as well.
